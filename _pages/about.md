I am Jingkai Bi, a master's student of Chongqing university. My academic focus centers on analyzing housing market using strcutural estimation. My research primarily explores the decision-making mechanisms of different types of housing market participants—especially short-term investors and first-time buyers—and their impacts on transaction prices, a direction deeply rooted in structural estimation methodologies, my working paper are below.

Flipping houses: Information, financing and housing price
======

**Abstract**
One driving force of soaring house prices may be the house flipping activities of short-term investors. Short-term investors in housing market profit from purchasing houses at relatively lower prices. To reveal its mechanisms from the prospective of buyers’ behaviors, we compare the search behaviors between short term investors and first-time buyers as they both prefer small houses with similar characteristics. And we construct a buyer search model to theoretically show that the short-term investors profit from his information advantage and lower-leverage advantage compared with the first-time buyer. Then we estimate short-term investors and first-time buyers’ primitive parameters and conduct counterfactual analyses by utilizing theoretical structures and data distinguishing first-time buyers and short-term investors with their payment information. Base on the housing transaction records in Guangzhou city from 2013 to 2016, We find that short-term investors purchase houses at 5.77% lower prices than first-time buyers due to the short-term investors’ 83% lower loan-to-value ratio. We illustrate that the expected house price increases with the loan-to-value ratio, and this effect is increasing with the buyer’s search cost. The findings demonstrate the importance of improving the information infrastructure of the housing market and increasing mortgage convenience in restraining flipping.
